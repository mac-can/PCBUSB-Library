# Running CAN and CAN FD on a Mac&reg;

The PCBUSB library realizes an USB to CAN user-space driver under macOS for PCAN-USB interfaces from PEAK-System Technik, Darmstadt.
It supports up to 8 PCAN-USB or PCAN-USB FD devices.
The library offers an easy to use API to read received CAN messages from a 64K message queue and to transmit CAN messages.
Standard CAN frames (11-bit identifier) as well as extended CAN frames (29-bit identifier) are supported.
The PCAN-USB FD device can be operated in CAN 2.0 and CAN FD mode.

## PCBUSB library

The dynamic library libPCBUSB is running under macOS 10.13 and later (Intel architecture and Apple silicon).
The API is almost compatible to PEAKÂ´s PCANBasic DLL on Windows.
See the [MacCAN](https://www.mac-can.com/) website for details.
