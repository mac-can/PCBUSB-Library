How to install the PCBUSB-Library on Mac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Download the Library

   First download the library either from the MacCAN homepage at <https://www.mac-can.com>
   or from the GitHub repo at <https://github.com/mac-can/PCBUSB-Library/releases>.

   Note: Archives with name prefix 'macOS_' contain the artifacts that are compiled as  
         Universal Binary for Intel x86_64 and Apple silicon. They require macOS 12.x
         (Monterey) or higher.
         Archives with name prefix 'OS_X_' contain the artifacts for OS X 10.x (Intel
         x86_64 only).
  
2. Install the Library

   Now open a terminal to extract the artifacts and to install the library.

   Note: In the following example I've downloaded version 0.13 from the MacCAN homepage.
         'makemake' is my username, 'uv-pc014mac' the name of my Mac.

2.1 Extract the Artifacts

    If you have downloaded the library as a tarball, type this:

    makemake@uv-pc014mac ~ % tar -xvf ~/Downloads/macOS_Library_for_PCANUSB_v0.13.tar

    If you have downloaded a compressed archive, then run this:

    makemake@uv-pc014mac ~ % tar -xzvf ~/Downloads/macOS_Library_for_PCANUSB_v0.13.tar.gz

2.2 Install the dylib

    To install the dylib you need superuser privileges. Type this:

    makemake@uv-pc014mac ~ % cd PCBUSB
    makemake@uv-pc014mac PCBUSB % sudo /Users/<your-username>/PCBUSB/install.sh
    Password: <your-password>

3. Using the library

   That's up to you.
