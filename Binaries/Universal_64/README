The PCBUSB library realizes a 'PCAN-USB Driver for macOS' using Apple´s IOUSBKit.
It supports up to 8 PCAN-USB or PCAN-USB FD devices from PEAK-System Technik.
See the header-file PCBUSB.h for details.

Limitations:
- CAN_Initialize():
  Only the following devices are supported:
  - PCAN-USB (item no. IPEH-002021 and IPEH-002022)
  - PCAN-USB FD (item no. IPEH-004022)
  - PCAN-USB Pro FD (item no. IPEH-004061), but only the first channel (CAN1)
- CAN_Write():
  Transmission of the given message on the CAN bus is not acknowledged by
  the USB interface.
  A transmission queue like in the Windows driver is not realized.
- CAN_FilterMessages():
  Message filtering is currently not supported.
- CAN_GetValue():
  Still unsupported parameter are: PCAN_5VOLTS_POWER, PCAN_MESSAGE_FILTER,
  PCAN_BUSOFF_AUTORESET, PCAN_LOG_LOCATION, PCAN_LOG_STATUS, PCAN_LOG_CONFIGURE,
  PCAN_LOG_TEXT, PCAN_CHANNEL_IDENTIFYING, PCAN_BITRATE_ADAPTING, PCAN_IP_ADDRESS,
  PCAN_LAN_SERVICE_STATUS, PCAN_INTERFRAME_DELAY, PCAN_ACCEPTANCE_FILTER_11BIT,
  PCAN_ACCEPTANCE_FILTER_29BIT, PCAN_ATTACHED_CHANNELS_COUNT, PCAN_ATTACHED_CHANNELS,
  PCAN_HARD_RESET_STATUS.
- CAN_SetValue():
  Still unsupported parameter are: PCAN_5VOLTS_POWER, PCAN_RECEIVE_EVENT,
  PCAN_MESSAGE_FILTER, PCAN_BUSOFF_AUTORESET, PCAN_LOG_LOCATION, PCAN_LOG_STATUS,
  PCAN_LOG_CONFIGURE, PCAN_LOG_TEXT, PCAN_CHANNEL_IDENTIFYING, PCAN_BITRATE_ADAPTING,
  PCAN_ALLOW_STATUS_FRAMES, PCAN_ALLOW_RTR_FRAMES, PCAN_ALLOW_ERROR_FRAMES,
  PCAN_INTERFRAME_DELAY, PCAN_ACCEPTANCE_FILTER_11BIT, PCAN_ACCEPTANCE_FILTER_29BIT,
  PCAN_ALLOW_ECHO_FRAMES, PCAN_HARD_RESET_STATUS.
- CAN_LookUpChannel():
  Channel searching is currently not supported.
- Writing into a trace file:
  Only 100'000 frames can be recorded into one trace file.
  An existing trace file with the same file name will be overwritten.

Known bugs and caveats
- The LED of the PCAN-USB FD device is not turned on (green) when the device
  is plugged into the USB bus. This is due to the fact that there is no 'real'
  driver for PCAN-USB devices under macOS. So the LED of the PCAN-USB FD device
  cannot signal the presence of a driver. When operating the LED signals the
  correct operation state of the PCAN-USB FD device (blinking green, or red
  on error).
- The same LED issue is for the PCAN-USB Pro FD device. The LED for the first
  channel signals its operation state only when operated by an application.
- The second channel of the PCAN-USB Pro FD device is not supported by the
  driver. It is not listed in the device list; its LED is turned off.
- When a successfully initialized PCAN-USB device is physically removed from
  USB any subsequent call of API functions (e.g. CAN_Read) will not succeed
  even when the device is plugged in again. An error code will be returned in
  this case.
