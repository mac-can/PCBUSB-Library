The PCBUSB library realizes a 'PCAN-USB Driver for OS X' using Apple«s IOUSBKit.
It supports up to 8 PCAN-USB devices from PEAK-System Technik, Darmstadt.
See the header-file PCBUSB.h for details.

Change-Log:
- Version 0.4 of 02/23/2014:
  Time-stamps are now taken from CAN controller instead of taking them from the
  system clock. 
  Getting and setting of PCAN_* parameters reworked (to be almost compatible to
  the PCANBasic DLL, version 1.3)
  Resetting of RCV and XMT queue on the CAN controller realized.
- Version 0.3 of 11/02/2013:
  Fixed issue #11 'All channel initialized by the application will be closed
  even if they are in use'.
  CAN_Unitialize: closing all channel initialized by the application at once
  implemented.
  CAN_Read: receive queue overrun handling reworked.
  CAN_*: wrong function return codes corrected.
  CAN_GetErrorText: language support for English, German, French, Italian and
  Spanish added.
- Version 0.2 of 09/08/2013: 
  Minor changes
- Version 0.1 of 06/30/2013: 
  Initial revision

Limitations:
- CAN_Initialize:
  Only PCAN-USB devices are supported; and only the first CAN channel of a 
  PCAN-USB device. 
- CAN_Write:
  Transmission of the given message on the CAN bus is not acknowledged 
  by the USB interface.
- CAN_FilterMessages:
  Message filtering is currently not supported.
- CAN_GetValue/CAN_SetValue:
  Still unsupported parameter are: PCAN_DEVICE_NUMBER, PCAN_5VOLTS_POWER,
  PCAN_RECEIVE_EVENT, PCAN_MESSAGE_FILTER, PCAN_BUSOFF_AUTORESET, PCAN_LOG_*,
  PCAN_RECEIVE_STATUS, PCAN_CONTROLLER_NUMBER, PCAN_CHANNEL_IDENTIFYING.
- Writing trace files:
  Only 100'000 frames can be recorded into one trace file.
  An existing trace file with the same file name will be overwritten.

Known bugs and caveats
- Due to the latency between the completions of the isochronous transaction on 
  the USB bus and servicing of the callback function, on slowed down systems a 
  mysterious repetition of already processed URBs may occur. In this case speed 
  up your system and everything works fine.
